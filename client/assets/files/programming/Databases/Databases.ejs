<h1 id="databases">Databases</h1>
<p>A database is an organized collection of data. Why does that matter? As information becomes more important so does the ability to retrieve and modify it. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to store that information in an organized way. Let’s illustrate with a story. Imagine you have some keys laying around your room. You are rushing out the door and need to find them quickly. Depending on how clean your room is will affect how much time and effort it takes you to find your keys. In a similar way we use databases to store hundreds of thousands or even millions of keys. Imagine trying to find one specific key among all of those.</p>
<p>Typically there are two specific types of database designs people use. They are relational and non-relational databases. For this discussion we will consider relational. Back to our story, the national key company decides to assign you as the town’s key keeper. People go to you and you find their keys to open their doors.</p>
<p>What if you only had a pile of blank keys and Mr. Joe asked you to get his house key? You would have a very difficult time. Instead what if you organized the keys into lockers labeled within sections of your house that way when you see Mr. Joe you can find his key based on the relationships you had set.</p>
<p>Think of it this way Mr. Joe asks for his key, you know his name so you look at your master sheet and discover that all people with a last name that starts with J have their keys stored in the back closet. You go back there and in the closet is a large locker with more labels inside. You know Mr. Joe’s first name is Mark so you find the drawer labeled M inside are a set of keys. As you look through this small bunch you find the match and return it to Mr. Joe.</p>
